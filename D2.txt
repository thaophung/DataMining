Michael Flynn set a record on Monday with his resignation as the White House national security adviser: No one in the 64-year history of the role had a shorter tenure than his, not by a long shot. President Trump accepted Flynn’s resignation late Monday, after Flynn acknowledged misleading Vice President Pence and other administration officials about his potentially illegal conversations with a Russian envoy. In his resignation letter, Flynn blamed the “fast pace of events” surrounding the White House transition for the lapse, saying he “inadvertently” gave the officials “incomplete information.” In total, he was on the job just 24 days.Most national security advisers last a lot longer. The position was created in 1953 by President Dwight Eisenhower, and was originally titled special assistant for national security affairs. Twenty-five people have held the position since then, not including Keith Kellogg, who was tapped by Trump to fill the role while the administration looks for Flynn’s replacement. Almost every national security adviser has served for more than a year, and most longer than that. The average is about 2.6 years. Henry Kissinger had the longest run, serving from early 1969 until late 1975. Until Flynn’s resignation, William H. Jackson had the shortest. A U.S. Army intelligence officer during World War II, Jackson rose through the ranks in the nation’s budding intelligence community and was eventually appointed special assistant for national security affairs in 1956. Eisenhower shuffled him out amid changes on the National Security Council just four months later, according to a White House history. It doesn’t seem to have been a controversial decision at the time.
